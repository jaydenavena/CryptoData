The yellow line is the mean we are reverting to. The Green and Red lines are 5th and 95th percentile markers respectively. The buy signal triggers when we drop underneath green, and the sell signal triggers when we cross over red and our mean is too far extended.

This shows examples of the buy/sell signals flashing. The opposite signal won't flash until the mean crosses into the extreme percentiles, despite the price being above or below the moving average.
